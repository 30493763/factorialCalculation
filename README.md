## Project Description

Create a C# Windows Forms Application that calculates the factorial of a given number using inbuilt Math functions.

## Key Components

TextBox txtInput for user to input an Integer to calculate Factorial

## Key Features

**ALGORITHEM**: This project uses 2 different algorithms to calculate the Factorial of an integer

*   Algorithm 1: Traditional _n! = n(n-1)(n-2)….1_, number of iteration equals to _n_
    
*   Algorithm 2: A simplied method with half of the number of iterations and time consumed in theory. See reference: <a href="url">https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/42510/what-are-the-benefits-of-cutting-by-half-the-number-of-multiplications-needed-to</a>
    

**ASYNCHROMOUS PROGRAMMING**: In order to avoid blocking and make good use of multi-thread. _Async-Await_ has been implemented.
